        <h1>Jack Dalton</h1>
        <p>
            You're probably wondering why this website is devoid of fancy
styling. That's a fair question, considering the state of many websites around
today.
        </p>
        <p>
            You see, before I adopted this design I'd see somebody else's
website and be intimidated by how much better theirs was. I'd spend some time
observing what they do right, and adopt it into my own design. This would happen
about once a month.
        </p>
        <p>
            After realizing that so much of my time was being taken up by this
frusterating cycle of upgrading, I switched to this design. The only CSS this
website has sets the font.
